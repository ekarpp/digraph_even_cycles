Implementation of the algorithm presented in chapter 4.2 of [The Shortest Even Cycle Problem is Tractable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02992). Done as a part of Master's thesis.

# Compilation
Executing `make` will build all binaries. Requires `g++` and x86-64 microarchitecture with support for PCLMULQDQ and BMI2 instruction set extensions. The binaries can be ran for further instructions.
