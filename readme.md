hello

# TODO
* one variable polynomials with coeff from F
  * needed only for la grange interpolation
* la grange interpolation
* permutation sgn computation?
* FMatrix mul diag
* ~~FMatrix det~~
* PMatrix det
  * make this in FMatrix, sample random things, multiply the two rows by monomial and grange interpolate
