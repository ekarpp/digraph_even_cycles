Implementation of the algorithm presented in chapter 4.2 of [The Shortest Even Cycle Problem is Tractable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02992). Done as a part of Master's thesis.

# TODO
* n distinct random gf elements? used in fmatrix pdet and solver, current implementation is not random
* implement fast modulus for GF ([see here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ipl.2010.04.011))
* further profiling after fast modulus for GF
